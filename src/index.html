      A Little Bit About Me
    </h3>
    <p>
    I am a self taught developer with the intention of making the web a more beautiful and interactive.
    I view the web as the perfect medium for creative expression as it offers endless ways of building, producing, and sharing content.
    Currently I enjoy working with HTML and CSS and I am on my way of mastering several other languages including Javascript, jQUery, php and more!
    On my free time I am about playing video games, guitar and making art and design.
